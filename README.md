# sd - shutdown

A small shutdown utility for MS-DOS.

I created it to use with DOS in VirtualBox, but it should work on any machine with APM 1.2 capability.

## Reboot

```console
sd -r
```

Or you can use the reboot command to have the same effect.

```console
reboot
```

## Halt

```console
sd -h
```

Or you can use the quit command.

```console
quit
```
